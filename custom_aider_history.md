<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants the application to display the task it was working on at the end. I need to find where in the code the final message is shown and modify it to include the task name.

Looking at the provided agent-aider-worktree.py code, there's a section where the final success panel is printed. The original code has a message about the task completing in iterations but doesn't mention the specific task. 

I'll search for the success message in the code. The relevant lines are in the main loop where tests pass and the merge is successful. The original code uses a Panel with a message that includes the iteration count and total time but not the task.

I need to modify that Panel to include the task. The existing line is:
"[bold]Task completed successfully in {iteration} iterations![/bold]\n"
I can add a line below that references the task from args.task. So the replacement would be:
f"[bold]Task completed successfully in {iteration} iterations![/bold]\n"
f"Task: {args.task}\n"

I must ensure that the SEARCH block exactly matches the existing code. The surrounding lines, like the total time and the style="green", should be included in the SEARCH to uniquely identify the location. 

Then, in the REPLACE block, I'll insert the new line with the task description. This way, when the code runs, the final message will display the specific task it was working on, fulfilling the user's requirement.


</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

I'll modify the final success message to include the task description. Here's the change:

agent-aider-worktree.py
````python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                            f"[bold]Task completed successfully in {iteration} iterations![/bold]\n"
                            f"Total time: {total_time}",
=======
                            f"[bold]Task completed successfully in {iteration} iterations![/bold]\n"
                            f"Task: {args.task}\n"
                            f"Total time: {total_time}",
>>>>>>> REPLACE
````

This change will add the specific task description to the final success message that appears when the tool completes its work. The task will be displayed prominently in the completion summary along with the iteration count and total time.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a Python script, agent-aider-worktree.py, and mentioned a syntax error at line 434. The error is a parsing failure, which usually means there's invalid syntax that Python can't understand.

Looking at the code snippet provided, line 434 starts with "6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:". That line isn't valid Python code—it looks like a comment or note that was accidentally left in the code. Python interprets this as a syntax error because it's expecting code, not a numbered list item.

The solution is to remove that line. The surrounding lines (432-433) show that after setting up the signal handler, there's a stray line causing the issue. By deleting line 434 and the following empty line, the code should parse correctly.

I'll create a SEARCH/REPLACE block to target those specific lines. The SEARCH part includes the signal handler setup and the problematic line, and the REPLACE part removes the invalid line. This should resolve the syntax error.


</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

The error is caused by a stray comment line that was accidentally left in the code. Let's remove it:

agent-aider-worktree.py
````python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:

    console.print(
=======
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

    console.print(
>>>>>>> REPLACE
````

This removes the invalid line number 434 that was causing the syntax error. The line was likely left over from a code review comment that wasn't properly removed.

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

    console.print(
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Did you mean to match some of these actual lines from agent-aider-worktree.py?

````
    def signal_handler(_sig, _frame):
        console.print(
            "\n[bold red]Received interrupt signal. Cleaning up...[/bold red]"
        )
        sys.exit(0)

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:

agent-aider-worktree.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main.[/dim]",
        console.print(
````

Are you sure you need this SEARCH/REPLACE block?
The REPLACE lines are already in agent-aider-worktree.py!

The SEARCH section must exactly match an existing block of lines including all white space, comments, indentation, docstrings, etc  

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user mentioned a syntax error in agent-aider-worktree.py line 434, which is causing a parsing failure. The error message shows that there's a line "6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:" in the code, which is definitely not valid Python syntax. 

Looking at the provided code for agent-aider-worktree.py, I see that after the signal_handler function and the signal.signal() call, there's this line that starts with "6. Fix line..." which is just a comment or note, not actual code. But in Python, comments should start with a #. This line is causing a syntax error because it's not properly commented out.

So the fix should be to remove that line entirely. The user tried to do that earlier, but the SEARCH block didn't match because the actual code includes some markdown or other text that wasn't part of the Python code. Wait, looking at the code snippet the user provided, there's a section that shows:

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:

agent-aider-worktree.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main.[/dim]",
        console.print(

Hmm, that "6. Fix line..." line is actually inside the Python code, which is invalid. So the correct approach is to delete that line. The previous attempt to remove it didn't work because the SEARCH block didn't exactly match the surrounding lines. 

I need to create a SEARCH block that includes the exact lines before and after the problematic line to ensure a unique match. The lines around the issue are:

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:

agent-aider-worktree.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main.[/dim]",
        console.print(

Wait, no, looking at the actual code the user provided in agent-aider-worktree.py, the main() function's code includes:

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:

agent-aider-worktree.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main//dim]",
        console.print(
            "\n[bold red]Received interrupt signal. Cleaning up...[/bold red]"
        )
        sys.exit(0)

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

    console.print(
        Panel.fit(
            "[bold cyan]Agent Aider Worktree[/bold cyan]\n"
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main.[/dim]",
            border_style="blue",
        )
    )

So the line "6. Fix line..." is actually part of the code, causing a syntax error. The correct fix is to remove that line. The SEARCH block should capture the exact lines before and after the problematic line. 

The problematic line is between the signal.signal() call and the console.print() for the panel. So the SEARCH block should include the line with signal.signal(), the problematic line, and the start of the next line. Then the REPLACE block would remove the problematic line.

So the correct SEARCH would be:

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:

agent-aider-worktree.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH

And the REPLACE would just have the signal.signal() line followed by the console.print().

Wait, but in the actual code, after the signal.signal() line, there's this line "6. Fix line..." and then some markdown-looking code. Wait, no, looking at the user's provided code in agent-aider-worktree.py, the main() function has:

def main():
    # Set up signal handlers for graceful exit
    import signal

    def signal_handler(_sig, _frame):
        console.print(
            "\n[bold red]Received interrupt signal. Cleaning up...[/bold red]"
        )
        sys.exit(0)

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:

agent-aider-worktree.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main.[/dim]",
        console.print(
            "\n[bold red]Received interrupt signal. Cleaning up...[/bold red]"
        )
        sys.exit(0)

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

    console.print(
        Panel.fit(
            "[bold cyan]Agent Aider Worktree[/bold cyan]\n"
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main.[/dim]",
            border_style="blue",
        )
    )

Wait, this is confusing. It seems like there's a mix of actual Python code and some markdown or other text within the Python file. The line starting with "6. Fix line..." is not part of the Python code but somehow ended up in the file, causing a syntax error. 

The correct approach is to remove the line "6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:" entirely. So the SEARCH block should capture the lines:

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:

    console.print(

But in the actual code, after the signal.signal() line, there's this line "6. Fix line..." followed by a code block that's not valid Python. Therefore, the SEARCH should be:

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:

agent-aider-worktree.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH

And the REPLACE would be:

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

    console.print(

But I need to make sure the SEARCH exactly matches the existing lines. Looking at the user's code, the lines after the signal.signal() are:

6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:

agent-aider-worktree.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main.[/dim]",
        console.print(

This seems like a misplaced code block or comment. The line "6. Fix line..." is causing the syntax error. So the correct SEARCH block should include the line with signal.signal(), followed by the problematic line, and then the next line which is the start of a code block. But since the code block is part of the file, it's invalid.

Wait, perhaps the user accidentally pasted a SEARCH/REPLACE block into their code. The line:

agent-aider-worktree.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH

Is part of a SEARCH/REPLACE block syntax, which is not valid Python. So these lines are causing the syntax error.

Therefore, the fix is to remove all these lines that are part of the SEARCH/REPLACE block that's mistakenly in the code. The lines causing the error are:

6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:

agent-aider-worktree.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main.[/dim]",
        console.print(
            "\n[bold red]Received interrupt signal. Cleaning up...[/bold red]"
        )
        sys.exit(0)

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

    console.print(
        Panel.fit(
            "[bold cyan]Agent Aider Worktree[/bold cyan]\n"
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main.[/dim]",
            border_style="blue",
        )
    )

This entire block is invalid because it includes a SEARCH/REPLACE syntax within the Python file. The user must have accidentally included this during a previous edit. 

So the correct fix is to remove the lines starting from "6. Fix line..." up to the closing triple backticks. But in the code provided by the user, the main() function's code includes these lines, which are not valid Python. 

Therefore, the SEARCH block should capture the exact lines from the signal.signal() call down to the start of the invalid code block, and the REPLACE block would remove those invalid lines, replacing them with the correct code.

Looking at the code:

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:

agent-aider-worktree.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main.[/dim]",
        console.print(
            "\n[bold red]Received interrupt signal. Cleaning up...[/bold red]"
        )
        sys.exit(0)

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

    console.print(
        Panel.fit(
            "[bold cyan]Agent Aider Worktree[/bold cyan]\n"
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main.[/dim]",
            border_style="blue",
        )
    )

This is all invalid in the Python file. The correct code should be:

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

    console.print(
        Panel.fit(
            "[bold cyan]Agent Aider Worktree[/bold cyan]\n"
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main.[/dim]",
            border_style="blue",
        )
    )

So the SEARCH block needs to capture the lines from "signal.signal(...)" down to the start of the invalid code, and the REPLACE block would have the corrected lines.

But how to structure the SEARCH/REPLACE block correctly? The key is to match the exact lines in the file. The lines causing the error are:

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:

agent-aider-worktree.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main.[/dim]",
        console.print(
            "\n[bold red]Received interrupt signal. Cleaning up...[/bold red]"
        )
        sys.exit(0)

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

    console.print(
        Panel.fit(
            "[bold cyan]Agent Aider Worktree[/bold cyan]\n"
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main.[/dim]",
            border_style="blue",
        )
    )

This is a mix of Python code and SEARCH/REPLACE syntax. The correct code should not have the "6. Fix line..." line and the markdown code block. So the SEARCH block should include all these lines, and the REPLACE block would have the corrected code.

But this is complicated. Perhaps the user's code has a SEARCH/REPLACE block embedded within it, which is causing the syntax error. The solution is to remove all those lines and replace them with the correct Python code.

So the correct SEARCH block would be:

agent-aider-worktree.py
````python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

6. Fix line length issues and string formatting:

agent-aider-worktree.py

        console.print(

        )
        sys.exit(0)

    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

    console.print(
        Panel.fit(
            "[bold cyan]Agent Aider Worktree[/bold cyan]\n"
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main.[/dim]",
            border_style="blue",
        )
    )
=======
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

            border_style="blue",
        )
    )
>>>>>>> REPLACE
````

But I need to ensure that the SEARCH block exactly matches the existing lines. The user's code includes the lines starting with "6. Fix line..." and the markdown code block, which are invalid. The SEARCH block must capture those exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's code has a misplaced SEARCH/REPLACE block from a previous edit that wasn't properly applied. In that case, the fix is to remove those lines entirely.

In conclusion, the correct SEARCH/REPLACE block should remove the invalid lines "6. Fix line..." and the embedded SEARCH/REPLACE syntax, replacing them with the correct Python code that continues after the signal.signal() call.


</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

I see the issue - there's a malformed code block comment that's causing the syntax error. Let's fix that section:

This removes the invalid markdown code block syntax that was embedded in the Python file and fixes the indentation. The error was caused by a leftover code block from a previous edit that wasn't properly cleaned up.

Okay, let's see what the problem is here. The user is getting a syntax error in their Python file when running pylint. The error is about an unexpected indent on line 441. Looking at the provided code, especially around the marked lines, I notice that there's a duplicate signal handler definition and some misplaced code.

In the main() function, the signal handler is defined twice. The first definition is correct, but then after the console.print() call, the same handler code is repeated, causing incorrect indentation and duplication. This repetition is likely causing the syntax error because the second definition isn't properly indented and is outside the main function's scope.

So the solution is to remove the duplicate signal handler code. The correct approach is to have the signal handler defined once inside the main function. The console.print() and Panel.fit() calls should follow after the handler is set up, without any stray code blocks. By deleting the duplicated lines, the indentation issues are resolved, and the syntax error should be fixed.


</thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

There's a duplicate signal handler definition and misplaced code in the main() function. Let's fix the indentation and remove the duplicate code:

agent-aider-worktree.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

    console.print(
        Panel.fit(
            "[bold cyan]Agent Aider Worktree[/bold cyan]\n"
            "[dim]Create a git worktree and run aider until tests pass, then merge back to main.[/dim]",

    )
            "\n[bold red]Received interrupt signal. Cleaning up...[/bold red]"
